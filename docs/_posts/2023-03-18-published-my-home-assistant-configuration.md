[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) is an awesome open-source home automation product that I have deployed to run my house.

I created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nzrunner/home-assistant) to: -

- Document my configuration (always a good thing)
- Have a backup of my configuration (another good thing)
- Contribute to the open-source community
- Learn GitHub

As I continue to make improvements to my smart home, I will be updating my configuration. Be sure to ‚≠ê my page and stay tuned for the latest updates.

Hopefully, as I have learned from others and "borrowed" sectons of their code, others can benefit from my configuration.

Sadly, I didn't keep a good record of the initial Home Assistant configurations that inspired me. If I stumble over them again, I will add them to the Acknowledgements section in my repository.

This blog will endeavour to document the updates I make to my configuration along with my experiences using GitHub as my knowledge repository.

Let me know your thoughts below.
