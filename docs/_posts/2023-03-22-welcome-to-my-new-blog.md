Gidday! My name is Mark Matheson. I'm a Digital Business Consultant based in Sydney, Australia.

Recently, I decided to publish my [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) configuration on [GitHub](https://github.com). This led me down the GitHub rabbit hole, learning the features of GitHub and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). To say it has been a steep learning curve would be an understatement. Having come out the other side with a wealth of experience, both good and bad, I thought I'd blog about it.

So, this blog, generated using GitHub Pages, making this another feature of GitHub that I've used. One of the next blogs will be about the process to get it published. And I have to say, it was incredibly frustrating.

In addition, I wil also be posting about the updates I make to my [Home Assistant configuration](https://github.com/nzrunner/home-assistant). Why not ‚≠ê my repo and follow along.
