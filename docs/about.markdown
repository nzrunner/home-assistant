Hi, I'm Mark Matheson, a Digital Business Consultant based in Sydney Australia with over 30 years experience working with various digital products including ERP, CRM, CMS, and numerous development platforms.

I currently run my own IT consultancy helping clients manage their digital business processes.

Part of my IT passion is driven by my smart home which is run by [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io). Having recently published my [Home Assistant configuration](https://nzrunner.github.com/nzrunner/home-assistant) on GitHub, I am now blogging about my Home assistant and GitHub experiences.
