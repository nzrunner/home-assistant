      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for ansible-core!**



      üí°
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
      would be useful in my repository. As a
      general rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest other users
      probably won't get pproved alone.

      I am trying to do X with your code on GitHub.
      I think that implementing a feature Y would be very helpful for me and

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet ü§∑


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_
