      **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in our Home Assist configuration!**


      ⚠
      Verify first that your issue is not [already reported on
      GitHub][issue search] and keep in mind that we may have to keep
      the current behavior because every change breaks someone's
      workflow. We try to be mindful about this.

    description: Explain the problem briefly below.
    placeholder: >-
      When I try to do X with your code I don't get the same output as your screenshots.
      Here are all the details I know about this problem...

          <em>Why?</em>
        </summary>

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunately, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet 🤷


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_

    # FIXME: Once GitHub allows defining the default choice, update this
