      **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in our Home Assistant configuration!**


      ⚠
      Verify first that your issue is not [already reported on
      GitHub][issue search] and keep in mind that we may have to keep
      the current behavior because every change breaks someone's
      workflow. We try to be mindful about this.

      Explain the problem briefly below, add suggestions to wording
      or structure.


      **HINT:** Did you know the documentation has a `View on GitHub`
      link on every page? Feel free to use it to start a pull request
      right from the GitHub UI!

      I was reading your documentation about option Y and I'm having
      problems understanding it. It would be very helpful if it got
      rephrased as Z.

          <em>Why?</em>

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet 🤷


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_

    # FIXME: Once GitHub allows defining the default choice, update this
